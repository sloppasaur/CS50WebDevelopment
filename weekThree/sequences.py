# This program looks at sequences

# A string is a sequence of characters:
name = "Nathaniel Barrera"

# prints the first index of the string
print(name[0])

# prints the second index of the string
print(name[1])

# an example of a list:
# a list is a sequence of mutable values
names = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"] # a list uses brackets []

# print the list
print(names)

# An example of a tuple
# Tuples are a sequence of immutable values
coordinate = (10.0 , 20.0) # a tuple uses parenthesis ()
